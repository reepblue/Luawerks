# luawerks
This is the README for the Luawerks.

Please use this repository to report bugs for Luawerks and looking up documentation via the Wiki.

The language used for this tracker is English. If this is a challenge, please consider using an online translator to convert your post into English. This does not extend to system information, but rather, only to actual report text.

# Conduct
There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

* Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
* Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
* Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
* Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Luawerks. As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated!

# Reporting Issues
If you encounter a bug while using Luawerks, first search the issue list to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

* a short, descriptive title;
* a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
* steps for reproducing the issue; and/or 
* an explaination of what you're trying to do.
